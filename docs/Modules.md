Programs, parts of programs separated to protect state or create swappable implementations, and libraries are all modules.  Programs are modules that define procedures the initial sandbox will call directly or indirectly and are loaded directly into a sandbox.  Libraries may define these procedures to run a program performing unit tests when they are loaded directly into a sandbox.
