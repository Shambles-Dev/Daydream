## Why Portability Matters




## The Plan

Do not expose proprietary hardware features, APIs, formats, or protocols.

These are host-specific
* the initial sandbox (kernel or runtime system; performs all I/O)
* the user interface (either implements a window system atop simpler I/O or passes windowing I/O through)
* the compiler (compiles to machine code)
