Good networking protocols resemble good governance models because networking protocols govern computers that represent people.  Their design (like a constitution) guarantees correctness (safety, like human rights), availability (stability, like a social safety net), and security (sovereignty, like preventing individuals (like individual computers) and nations (like private networks) from being destroyed or subverted) by using closed loop (feedback) control (like democracy).  They distribute power evenly (unlike dictatorships) to minimize the harm of individual computers being destroyed or subverted.  The same rules govern all computers (like just law enforcement).  Disputes are resolved by consensus in a way that excludes attackers, maximizes utility (like happiness), and allocates resources proportionately (e.g. STAR voting and the d'Hondt method with open list).

Freedom of speech is essential to such a system.  It requires the ability to communicate efficiently without being censored or retaliated against.

Layered transformations can enforce freedom of speech.  Layering eases maintenance and reuse.  Layers can be omitted or their implementation swapped.

The algorithms used for files and network connections differ.

Good networking protocols resemble living systems because networks must adapt to survive and grow.  They self-(re)configure, self-protect, self-heal, and self-optimize.

Macroni does not provide these features because their use requires cooperation.
