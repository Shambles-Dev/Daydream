Would-be users’ data is in file systems and databases, not Macroni images.  Macroni must support a way to import their data.  Would-be users would (and should) reject Macroni if it did not support a way to export their data.

Using file systems and databases is consistent with Macroni’s theme of hard/soft-state separation.  File systems and databases use standard formatting, and sometimes error-correcting codes or modular redundancy, to make it possible to recover data when storage devices partially fail.  That is not true of most data stored in memory.
